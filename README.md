# Recipe Tracker

## Project Overview

    Goal: Develop a recipe tracker application that stores recipes with ingredients, preparation instructions, and a cover image. The app will allow for unit conversions and categorization of recipes. AI-driven suggestions will enhance user experience.

## Tech Stack

    Frontend: React
        Utilize React for its component-based architecture, enabling reusable UI components.
    Backend: Rust
        Choose Rust for its performance, safety, and concurrency features. It's an excellent choice for handling complex backend logic efficiently.
    Database: PostgreSQL
        Use PostgreSQL for its robustness, support for complex queries, and compatibility with diverse data types, which is ideal for storing recipes, ingredients, and related metadata.

## Core Features

    Recipe Database
        Store recipes with fields for name, ingredients, preparation steps, and cover images.
        Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for recipes.

    Ingredients and Preparation Instructions
        Include detailed ingredients lists with quantities and units.
        Store step-by-step preparation instructions.
        Consider using rich text formatting for instructions to include images or videos.

    Unit Conversion
        Implement a feature to convert ingredient units (e.g., grams to ounces).
        Use a library or API for accurate conversions between metric and imperial units.

    Recipe Categorization
        Allow recipes to be categorized by type (e.g., steak, cake, Japanese).
        Implement tags or categories for easier searching and organization.

    AI-Driven Suggestions
        Integrate AI to suggest recipes based on user preferences, ingredients on hand, or nutritional goals.
        Consider machine learning models for personalized recommendations.

## Additional Ideas

    User Accounts and Authentication
        Implement user authentication to save personalized recipes and preferences.
        Use JWT tokens for secure and stateless authentication.

    Search Functionality
        Implement a search feature to find recipes based on ingredients, names, or categories.
        Consider full-text search for more efficient searching capabilities.

    Nutritional Information
        Include nutritional information for recipes (calories, macronutrients, etc.).
        Offer the option to adjust recipes for dietary needs (e.g., vegan, keto).

    Social Features
        Allow users to rate and review recipes.
        Implement sharing features for recipes on social media.

    Internationalization
        Support multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
        Consider cultural variations in cooking terms and units.

    Mobile Responsiveness
        Ensure the application is responsive on various devices, especially mobile phones and tablets, to allow users to access recipes on the go.

    Offline Access
        Consider using service workers for offline access to recipes that have been previously loaded.

    Scalability
        Plan for scalability from the start. Consider using Docker and Kubernetes for easier deployment and scaling.

## Development Considerations

    Version Control: Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
    Testing: Implement unit and integration tests, especially for the backend logic and API endpoints.
    Documentation: Document the API endpoints and application usage for easier onboarding of new developers or users.
    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
